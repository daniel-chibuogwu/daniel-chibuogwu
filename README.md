### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building Flickwheel's Mobile App, My Personal Portfolio and Blog
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NodeJs and Web animations using GSAP
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on blogs, frontend web and mobile app projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with react and react native bugs for both web and mobile applications
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Javascript, TailwindCSS, Typescript, NextJS, React Native, Expo, css animations, GSAP and  NodeJS.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I Love TailwindCSS so much that I can remember most utility classes without looking at the docsðŸ˜„
